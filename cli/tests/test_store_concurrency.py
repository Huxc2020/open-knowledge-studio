"""Cross-process tests for the Store's read/modify/write locks.

``_file_lock`` coordinates mutations both across processes (an OS file lock) and
inside a single interpreter (a thread lock). The defects these tests pin down
only appear when two *processes* touch the same file, so every writer runs in
its own interpreter: threads of the test process would be serialised by the
thread lock even if the file lock were missing, and the test would then pass
with or without the fix.
